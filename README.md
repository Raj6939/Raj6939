- 👋 Hi, I’m Raj!
- 👀 I am a Developer Advocate at Hypersign, where I have a passion for coding and engaging with developers to discuss topics related to digital identity.
- 🔨 My expertise lies in Javascript, VueJS, ReactJS, Solidity, NodeJs, MongoDB, web3js, tokenomics, NFT, cryptography, SSI, and web wallets.
- 🌱 Currently, I am focused on working with technologies such as SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity), DID (Decentralized Identifiers), verifiable credentials, and ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs). I am actively involved in building the ecosystem for [Hypersign](https://hypersign.id), which is a decentralized identity infrastructure.
- 💞️ I thoroughly enjoy discussing digital identity, SSI, and DIDs. These topics fascinate me, and I'm always excited to explore their potential and impact.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at raj.v.patil108@gmail.com. I would love to connect and engage in conversations surrounding identity and related technologies.
